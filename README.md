# Valorant Match Analysis — EDA on My First 1000 Games

Welcome to my first Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this analysis, I explore my personal dataset of 1,000 Valorant matches over the past year using Python, with the goal of uncovering insights about agent performance, rank progression, and win conditions.

#📌 Project Overview

This project aims to answer several strategic questions based on in-game data from Riot Games' popular FPS Valorant, using various data analysis and visualization techniques. While the dataset is personal, the methodology is generalizable to other players or match logs.

# 🔍 Questions Explored

Which agents have the highest or lowest average kills?

Do certain agents correlate with higher win rates?

When did I perform best — in which Episodes or Acts?

Who were the best-performing agents in each Episode?

How did my rank change over time?

Can we predict a match outcome based on pre-game parameters?

What contributed to my most dominant victories (e.g., 13–1 wins)?

# 📈 Key Findings & Insights

✅ 83% prediction accuracy using Logistic Regression for match outcomes.

🎯 ACS (Average Combat Score) and K/D Ratio were the most significant indicators of match success.

🦸‍♀️ Reyna had the highest win rate (53%) among all agents played.

📊 Tracked rank progression and noticeable improvements over time.

🔍 Identified the "recipe" for dominant wins, including agent comp and familiarity with specific maps.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
